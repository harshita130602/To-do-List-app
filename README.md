# To-do-List-app
It is a basic to-do list app which is made by using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It doesn't have local storage right now and I am working on it.

You can perform the following tasks by using the app:
1. Add the tasks you want to get done.
2. Mark all those tasks that has been done.
3. Delete any task as per your wish.

HOW TO RUN?
1. git clone https://github.com/harshita130602/To-do-list-app
2. cd To-do-list-app
3. Click on the file named app.py and open it with a browser.
