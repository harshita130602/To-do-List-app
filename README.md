# To-do-List-app
It is a basic to-do list app which is made by using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It doesn't have local storage right now and I am working on it.

You can perform the following tasks by using the app:
* Add the tasks you want to get done.
* Mark all those tasks that has been done.
* Delete any task as per your wish.

**How to run it in the system**
* git clone https://github.com/harshita130602/To-do-List-app
* cd To-do-List-app
* Now open the index.html file in your browser.
